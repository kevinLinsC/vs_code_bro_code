            Rex made the beat, so you know I gotta murder it
            They act all tough, but in person, they be murmuring
            And mumbling, pull out the gun they get to stumbling, tumbling
            And the chopper get to thundering
            Shitting on all these haters, like, where the plunger at?

            I'm excited, 'cause now I can throw a party
            And all the people that hated on me won't be invited
            True Religion on me like the Buddha, Indian style, I'm enlightened
            I remember up in kindergarten
            The teacher told me I wouldn't be shit
            And then she saw me play the piano
            And made all the other kids sea sick

            Even though I got a couple demons, I'm still screaming out, "Thank Jesus"
            Upside down pyramid on me just to compliment the Jesus pieces
            I was a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh, that's why I pull cards on these stupid hoes
            Got a arrow got a bullet, Cupid hoe, ha yeah

            I pop Percs to numb all the pain 'cause it hurt to live
            I gotta take everything 'cause sometimes it hurt to give
            I make money even though sometimes it don't make sense
            Speaking of taking everything
            It's time to take shits on every single person that said I wouldn't do it
            Every single person that said I was stupid
            Every single person that said I was that Netflix special
            What's the name of the show? Oh, Clueless

            But no, I ain't clueless I got this, I'm on top, so now nobody can top this
            Now it's time to change the topic, I got a way with words
            Like I'm running with a phonics book
            In school, I didn't do the homework, but I still got the subjects
            Money ain't the object, money is the objective, gotta admit that

            I'm successful, but I feel like my head sometimes a little dreadful
            I grew up on rock, rap, heavy metal, now I'm ridin' bikes, pedal to the metal
            I don't even gotta pedal, it's a throttle so excuse me
            These niggas faker than some optical illusions, I be looking like
            "What the fuck is you doing?"

            You ain't getting money, you ain't changing shit
            You ain't changing the world, you just stupid
            Talkin' bout you crackin' cars, selling drugs, killing niggas, and going hard
            Watch a real nigga come up in your car, now you looking all scared
            You finna piss yourself, shit yourself, you gotta admit yourself
            You need some help
            I gotta admit myself, I'm on these drugs feel like I can't save myself
            Sometimes I wanna take myself and break myself
            
            So I can reshape myself, huh
            Nobody ever felt the pain I felt, so I share it
            And put it out to the whole world, I ain't embarrassed
            Bunch of these niggas is my sons
            I apologize to 'em 'cause I been a bad parent
            Don't try me 'cause I'm not the one, see I won't even count to two
